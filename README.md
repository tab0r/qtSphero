# Sphero.Swarms
An exploration of swarm robotics with Sphero, based on python and theano

The strategy can either result from the behaviour of the single figures (like ants, bees or robots)
or be fully supervised on the game level like in chess or be a combination of both like in economy, society or war.

The program uses python, jupyter, and keras with a theano back end. It will run on most Unix (Linux, Mac) but probably not directly on Windows.

It's coded with Python 3.6 on Mac OS X.
